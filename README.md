## Database Schema

The application uses Firebase Firestore with the following collections:

- `users`: User profiles and authentication data
- `userProfiles`: Detailed user information and preferences
- `mealLogs`: Food logging entries with images and nutrition data
- `dietPlans`: AI-generated personalized diet plans
- `chatMessages`: User-AI chat history

## AI Integration

### Food Detection

The application uses a pre-trained EfficientNet model for food detection. The model files should be placed in:

```
public/
└── models/
    ├── efficientnet.pth
    └── categories.txt
```

### Nutrition Analysis

The application uses Google's Gemini AI to:
- Generate personalized diet plans
- Provide nutrition advice
- Calculate nutritional values
- Offer meal suggestions
